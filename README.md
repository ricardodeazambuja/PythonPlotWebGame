# PythonPlotWebGame
A simple browser controlled game in Python

This game uses Matplotlib.pyplot to generate an animation on the server and registers users/receives commands using a web browser. I developed this game in a hurry for a staff development day. Two *spaceships* fire against each other and two groups of people control the spaceships in a shared way. The graphics are simply terrible, but the *main* gameplay idea is kind of cool. 

Everything, but the images used on the controller page, are generated inside this notebook:
